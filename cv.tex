\subsection*{Positions as ph.d. student at Aarhus University}

\paragraph{CS Challenge} I have managed the early talent program for ambitious
first year students for 2 years in collaboration with Professor Michael
Schwartzbach, pitting about 15 students each year up against custom, hand-made
Computer Science problems for their extra engagement in their studies. As a
direct result of our efforts, the Institute was the best prepared for when the
faculty instated mandatory talent programs for all courses of study.

\paragraph{Visitors Service} I have participated in the departments programme
for visiting high school and secondary school students. Here I give more or less
interactive presentations to give them a sense of what it is like to study at a
university, in general, and at the institute of computer science, specifically.
